  "significance":"Is written by Miranda just after Elizabeth and Arthur's relationship is is first revealed to both her and the audience. This metaphorically shows the current state of Miranda's life. But this quote appears multiple times throughout the novel as the Dr Eleven comics get passed around between characters. The quote first appears when Kirsten introduces the audience to the comics that Arthur Leander gave her symbolising the collapse of society after the Georgia flu. It also comes up again when Miranda and Arthur meet for the first time in 15 years just before Arthurâ€™s death symbolising the degradation of Arthur's life with the break up of him and Elizabeth and the losing of his son which Miranda notes earlier in the chapter.",
